# Entwine
Entwine lets you play through interactive stories told via Markdown documents. It's little more than a viewer for Markdown documents, but one that lets you browse them in style, specifically designed to aid in progression through interactive stories.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple language for plain text that uses a number of accessible symbols to make it super easy to create neatly formatted documents. With it, you can create text files with formatting for headers, emphasized content like bold or italicized text and lists and links to other resources.

## Markdown Example
Maybe it'll help to explain it through a comparison with Microsoft Word. In word, you'd normally type some text and then highlight and add bold or italic styling. In most Markdown editors, you simply add a symbol before and maybe after your typed text. No mouse needed.

For example, to create a header, you could add a `#` symbol and space before your header:
`# My New Document`

MS Word now supports Markdown, though it's really the workflow Markdown offers through plain text eitors that makes it so appealing.

## How Entwine Works
Entwine is really just a viewer for Markdown documents, such as this one, for example. This document is just a Markdown formatted file with a bunch of headers and anchor links pointing to those headers. A Markdown document reader lets you click links to go to those headers. That's really all Entwine does.

## Designed for Elegance
You can use any capable reader for browsing through Markdown documents. In fact, you can view Markdown documents right through free services like GitHub Gist where this document is stored. So why use Entwine?

Entwine is designed for interactive storytelling. In general, it displays content on an as-needed basis, letting you progress through an elegant interface that can be configured for the story being told.
