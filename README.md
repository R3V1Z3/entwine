# Entwine
Entwine lets you play through interactive stories told via Markdown documents. It's little more than a viewer for Markdown documents, but one that lets you browse them in style, in an animated way designed for interactive storytelling.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple language for plain text that uses a number of accessible symbols to make it super easy to create neatly formatted documents. With it, you can create text files with formatting for headers, emphasized content like bold or italicized text and lists and links to other resources.

## Markdown Example
Maybe an example will help. When using a Markdown editor, to create a header, you just type a `#` symbol and a space followed by your header text. No mouse highlighting is needed, just a couple extra characters and your desired text.

So basically, you just enter something like this:  
`# My New Document`

## How Entwine Works
Entwine is really just a viewer for Markdown documents, such as this one, for example. This document is just a Markdown formatted file with a bunch of headers and anchor links pointing to those headers. A Markdown document reader lets you click links to go to those headers. That's really all Entwine does.

## Designed for Elegance
You can use any capable reader for browsing through Markdown documents. In fact, you can view Markdown documents right through free services like GitHub Gist where this document is stored. So why use Entwine?

Entwine is designed for interactive storytelling. In general, it displays content on an as-needed basis, letting you progress through an elegant interface that can be configured for the story being told.
