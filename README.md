# Entwine
Entwine is a dead simple engine to play interactive (or Choose Your Own Adventure) stories created using Markdown through any capable browser.

## Purpose

There are several outstanding, modern tools for easily creating interactive stories. Among the newer ones are [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and [Ficdown](https://ficdown.com/). So why another?

Twine is amazing but it's strangely tough to learn and files created with it are only accessible via Twine or after a complex compilation process. Ficdown is brilliant too, it relies on the popular Markdown formatting language so files are readily accessible. However, it handles anchor links in a special way that entails 

So what if we implement a method similar to Ficdown that maintains internal links, so that interactive games can be played using any capable Markdown viewer?

That's the goal of this project. To rely on the popular Markdown formatting language for the ultimate in accessibility.
