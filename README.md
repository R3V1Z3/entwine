# Entwine
Entwine lets you play through interactive stories told via Markdown documents. It's little more than a viewer for Markdown documents, but one that lets you browse them in style, in an animated way designed for interactive storytelling.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple language for plain text that practically eliminates the need for mouse interaction and makes it super easy to format content. Using common symbols like `#` and `-`, you can create neatly formatted documents with ease.

- [Great, tell me more about Entwine.](#how-entwine-works)

## Markdown Example
Maybe an example will help. When using a Markdown editor, to create a header, you just type a `#` symbol and a space followed by your header text. No mouse highlighting is needed, just a couple extra characters and your desired text.

So basically, you just enter something like this:  
`# My New Document`

## How Entwine Works
Entwine is really just a viewer for Markdown documents, such as this one. This document is just a Markdown formatted file with a bunch of headers and anchor links pointing to those headers. A Markdown document reader lets you click links to go to those headers. That's really all Entwine does.

## Designed for Elegance
You can use any capable reader for browsing through Markdown documents. In fact, you can view Markdown documents right through free services like GitHub Gist where this document is stored.  

So why use Entwine?  

Entwine is designed for interactive storytelling. In general, it displays content on an as-needed basis, letting you progress through an elegant interface that can be configured for the story being told.

- [Configured? How?](#configurable)

## Configurable
Entwine is fully themable/skinnable using CSS. For those unfamiliar with CSS, there are a bunch of ready-made themes to learn from or just use as needed. It's also been designed to work with a Markdown file that offers a lot of power without the need to program.

Moreover, the project is built for GitHub Pages. At no cost and with practically zero effort, the project can be copied(forked) into a web-ready website, hosted for free through GitHub.

## GitHub and GitHub Pages
GitHub is a developer focused code-hosting platform. GitHub Pages lets you host code for HTML websites at no cost. With that, you can host your own Entwine-driven website for free.

## Markdown configuration
This Markdown file contains some hidden options that let you configure some basic options for how the app works.

## Themes
Glad you asked. We've got a growing list of Entwine-compatible themes from a few, somewhat similar projects. Check out the themes using the CSS Theme selector in the info panel.
